* brave-clojure-exercises
Solutions to the exercises in the book /Clojure for the Brave and True/.

The goal of this project is to provide clear, readable, and idiomatic
solutions for each exercise, primarily for my own learning and as a
reference.

** Project Structure
All solutions are located within the [[file:src/brave_clojure_exercises/]]
directory. The files are named according to the book's chapters:

- =ch03-do-things.clj=
- =ch04-core-functions-in-depth.clj=
- ...and so on.

Inside each file, comments are used to clearly delineate which
exercise solution follows.

** Usage
These solutions are intended to be explored interactively using a
Clojure REPL. Choose the method that best fits your workflow.

The easiest way to explore the solutions is to connect your editor
(e.g., Emacs with CIDER, VS Code with Calva, or IntelliJ with Cursive)
to a REPL.

1. Start a REPL from the project's root directory.
2. Connect your editor to the running REPL.
3. Open the chapter file you want to review (e.g.,
   [[file:src/brave_clojure_exercises/ch03-do-things.clj]].
4. Evaluate the code line-by-line or form-by-form directly from the
   file into the REPL. This is the "interactive manner" the project
   was designed for.

You can also copy and paste the lines of interest in a simple Clojure
REPL.
